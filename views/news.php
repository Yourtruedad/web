<h4>New Event</h4>
				<p>Dear Players, a new week and a new event for you. It is called <strong>the Revenge of the Red Dark Knight</strong>. On Manday (May 2nd) in Lorencia at 16:00, 20:00 and 23:00 a bad and cruel Dark Knight will show up. It will be there to cause havoc on the MU continent. He also wants to destroy all heroes who wants to stop him. He will be there for an hour unless someone will be able to destroy him. Whoever will be able to do that will receive an <strong>ancient item</strong>. May this trophy be respected by the winner. </p>
				<p>Secondly, a short maintenance is necessary on the Active server so on Sunday evening it will be restarted. It will be offline for a minute. </p>

<h4>Maintenance</h4>
				<p>A quick update from the administration. As you all know there are some connectivity issues on our server. There is a bug in the server files. However, the server files provider will have a patch ready tonight. When we have it, we will update the server files immediately.</p>
				<p>Because of that a <strong>short maintenance will be required</strong>. It should take around <strong>15 minutes</strong> to apply the patch. The server will be unavailable during that time. The patch should be available around midnight (0:00 GMT+1) so expect the downtime around that time. It will also be a good opportunity for us to <strong>apply the changes</strong> mentioned in the <strong>previous message</strong> so there won't be the downtime on April 20th.</p>
				<p>We are really sorry for the inconvenience but we hope that more players will join us really soon as a result. Don't forget about the new event!</p>

				<h4>Server Updates</h4>
				<p>Dear Players, on April 20th, 2016 at 19:00 GMT+1 there will be a short maintenance to be able to introduce several changes described below.</p>
				<ul>
				    <li>Every new character and every character that hasn’t been reset before will get <strong>additional 100 Level Up Points</strong>. If you have a character that you created earlier but you did not reach your first reset, you will get additional 100 points too.</li>
					<li>We will add to in-game shops items that will not ruin the economy on our server but they will be useful for new players (i.e. Bone+3+12 and equivalents).</li>
					<li>Rings level 40 and 80 will give you <strong>300,000 Zen or a jewel</strong> that will give you easy access to potions for new and low level characters. </li>
					<br>
					<li><strong>NEW EVENT</strong>: Mini Golden Dragon. From now on every Golden Invasion will also spawn a Small Golden Dragon. The best thing about it is that pretty much every character will be able to kill it. It will have a small damage and defence rate but lots of health points. It will try to survive without being able to kill anyone. If you manage to kill it, it will drop a BoK+4.</li>
				</ul>

<h4>Player of the Day and Player of the Week</h4>
<p>Dear Players, it is time to start our first server event. As you can see on our website, we announce who is the <strong>Player of the Day</strong>. It is a character that is #1 in our <a href="?module=score_ranking">score ranking</a>. Starting tomorrow (11.04.2016) we will award a player of the day with a <strong>Box of Kundun +4</strong>. The Player of the Week (a player that was a player of the day the most often during a week) will get <strong>3x Box of Kundun +4</strong>. So that's worth fighting for. The rewards will be delivered to your warehouse.</p>
<p>Secondly, we would like to let you know that a <strong>scheduled maintenance</strong> will occur tomorrow (11.04.2016) at 11 pm (GMT+1) and the server will be offline for around 10 minutes. This is required to fix a few bugs including the issue with getting DC.</p>
<p class="text-right"><small>2016-04-10 20:13</small></p>

<h4>Drop Update</h4>
<p>Dear Players, we have adjusted slightly the drop system on our server. Now you will notice that items such as: jewels, Red Box, Purple Box and Summon (level 1 - 3) drop more often. Nothing else has changed. We have noticed that the amount of jewels is not enough to build a good set. So we have increased the drop slightly.</p>
<p class="text-right"><small>2016-04-04 20:05</small></p>

<h4>The opening</h4>
<p>Dear Player, we are really glad that the server has started and so many of you joined already. More than 100 players were online in just a few minutes after the start. We hope that this number will be growing rapidly.</p>
<p>Everyone is invited. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us on our <a href="http://forum.everwintermu.com" title="Message Board">message board</a>. See you all on the server!</p>

<h4>Let's try it again.</h4>
<p>Dear Players, we, administrator, unfortunately have made several mistakes with the server configuration. The majority of them were insignificant but we managed to adjust them in just a few minutes so it means you probably did not even notice them. Nonetheless, everything should have been perfect because we are not new at this. Every mistake that we made caused players to leave the server. Probably the biggest one was at the very beginning which was about disabling the possibility to use the multi client and the Elf Buffer at level 30.</p> 
<p>After some time we managed to convince you, new players, that you can trust us because we are trying to make the server the best we possibility can. The number of active players was getting higher to reach 100 online on a very difficult server. We though that everything is going well. The server was online for 8 days without any outages. We managed to avoid DDoS attacks and get rid of cheaters from the server. We did not want to brag about it because it was our job.</p> 
<p>However, right now the only thing that we can do is to apologise. We have made one mistake which resulted in the issue with our database and we lost some data from it. The backup that we could make is corrupted and we are unable to recover anything from it. We have found the issue, fixed it and now everything is fine.</p> 
<p>We believe that the settings on our server were unique enough that you enjoyed the time you spent with us. We hope that you have found what you were looking for. Restarting the game from the backup could result in loosing many players. Therefore we decided to wipe the database and start fresh. The settings will stay the same.</p> 
<p>All players who bought wCoins will have them back (all of them) on the next edition of the server.</p> 
<p>The truth is that it is up to you whether the server will continue. Will you give us the second chance? Think about this and decide. If you still would like to stay with us, please spread the word that we are going come back. We believe that with the fresh start we can get even more players to make the game even more entertaining. We will come back better and stronger. We know this!</p>
<p>Everyone is invited to join the server which will launch again on <strong>Friday, April 1st, 2016</strong>. You will be able to create your new account on March 29th. </p>
<p>All players who bought wCoins, please contact us at <strong>admins@everwintermu.com</strong> to let us know how many wCoins you had and on which account they should be added. You will need only the transaction ID and your new login name.</p>

<h4>The First Castle Siege</h4>
<p>The very first CS on our server has been completed. The <strong>TiTaN</strong> guild lead by <strong>RasAlGhul</strong> this time defeated the <strong>True</strong> guild lead by <strong>The0ne</strong>. Congratulations to TiTaNs!. We hope that the next week the siege will be even more exciting.</p>
<p>Secondly, we would also like to let you know that two first players managed to reach the maximum level and reset their characters - <strong>RasAlGhul</strong> and <strong>KlauS</strong> - well done guys!</p>
<p>Lastly, more and more players join EverWinter MU. We are really happy that it is so. Everyone is welcome.</p>

<h4>The /offtrade command</h4>
<p>A quick update - if you want to you the /offtrade command, you will need to go to Noria on the Passive subserver.</p>
<p class="text-right"><small>2016-03-19 15:43</small></p>

<h4>New Score Ranking</h4>
<p>Dear Players, we have introduced a new character ranking on our website. It is the <strong>Score Ranking</strong> which you can see if you <a href="?module=score_ranking">click here</a>. The new ranking will show who is the best player because there are several elements of the game that it measures (not just level and reset). In order to be the best, <u>you need to do events, win duels, increase your Gens rank and also gather money</u>.</p>
<p>The Score Ranking refreshes every 24h. Check now who is the best so far and try to be number 1. If you have any questions regarding how this works, you can reach out to us on our message board.</p>
<p class="text-right"><small>2016-03-18 18:06</small></p>
<hr>
<h4>Message Board Update</h4>
<p>Just a quick update from the administration. We have changed the privacy settings on our forum. It means that now you will need to create your account and log in to browse the content. We have also added a new Shoutbox to let you communicate with us easily (<a href="http://forum.everwintermu.com/index.php?p=/discussion/95/new-shoutbox-on-our-forum#latest" target="_blank">read more</a>).</p>

<h4>Further Changes</h4>
<p>We hope that you like the fact that the <strong>MuBot</strong> is now available for <strong>free</strong> on the Passive sub-server. We think it was a good change and now the Passive sub-server is more popular. However, we have made a few more changes in the configuration of the server:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We have <strong>increased</strong> the selling price of jewels in in-game shops. The new prices are now as follows: Bless - 690 000, Soul - 460 000, Creation - 770 000, Life - 1 150 000.</li>
    <li>We have also found a minor bug in the client which could have caused a connection issue for some players. Luckily it has been fixed quickly and now everything should be fine. No need to download any patch manually. Our launcher will do this for you. More about this on our <a href="http://forum.everwintermu.com/index.php?p=/discussion/92/language-and-reconnect-system-news#latest">message board</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also working on some new features for our website. They will be available soon.</p>

<h4>Reset Price And Exp. Rate Updates</h4>
<p>Dear Players, we would like to let you know that we have introduced a few changes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <strong>exp. rate</strong> while playing in party has been slightly <strong>increased</strong>.</li>
    <li>The new price of the <strong>character reset</strong> is now 30,000,000 Zen.</li>
    <li>We have also slightly lowered the HP of Snakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any suggestions, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

<h4>Two Days After The Launch</h4>
<p>The server has started successfully for all two days ago (March 12th, 2016). We are really happy that so many of you joined us. We are still adjusting some things in the configuration of the server and <strong>we have a few updates for you</strong>.</p>
<p>We have changed the price of the <strong>MuBot</strong> on the <strong>Passive</strong> server. <strong>Now it is totally free</strong> so your income for the time you played AFK will be much more significant.</p>
<p>We would also like to let you know the you can find in the game an item called <strong>Box of Tickets</strong>. If you find it and use it, you will get a free invitation to one of the in-game events. What is more, if you find i.e. a DS (Devil Square) invitation, it will work on all DS levels (DS1 to DS). So the invitation works on all event levels.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have also added a new feature on our website that you can see below. It’s the Event Calendar and it allows you to check really quickly when is the next i.e. BC. I hope you like it.</p>
<p>Please also remember that you can contact us if you have any issues on our <a href="http://forum.everwintermu.com" target="_blank">message board</a>.</p>
