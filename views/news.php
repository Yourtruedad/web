<h4>New Score Ranking</h4>
<p>Dear Players, we have introduced a new character ranking on our website. It is the <strong>Score Ranking</strong> which you can see if you <a href="?module=score_ranking">click here</a>. The new ranking will show who is the best player because there are several elements of the game that it measures (not just level and reset). In order to be the best, <u>you need to do events, win duels, increase your Gens rank and also gather money</u>.</p>
<p>The Score Ranking refreshes every 24h. Check now who is the best so far and try to be number 1. If you have any questions regarding how this works, you can reach out to us on our message board.</p>

<h4>Further Changes</h4>
<p>We hope that you like the fact that the <strong>MuBot</strong> is now available for <strong>free</strong> on the Passive sub-server. We think it was a good change and now the Passive sub-server is more popular. However, we have made a few more changes in the configuration of the server:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We have <strong>increased</strong> the selling price of jewels in in-game shops. The new prices are now as follows: Bless - 690 000, Soul - 460 000, Creation - 770 000, Life - 1 150 000.</li>
    <li>We have also found a minor bug in the client which could have caused a connection issue for some players. Luckily it has been fixed quickly and now everything should be fine. No need to download any patch manually. Our launcher will do this for you. More about this on our <a href="http://forum.everwintermu.com/index.php?p=/discussion/92/language-and-reconnect-system-news#latest">message board</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also working on some new features for our website. They will be available soon.</p>

<h4>Two Days After The Launch</h4>
<p>The server has started successfully for all two days ago (March 12th, 2016). We are really happy that so many of you joined us. We are still adjusting some things in the configuration of the server and <strong>we have a few updates for you</strong>.</p>
<p>We have changed the price of the <strong>MuBot</strong> on the <strong>Passive</strong> server. <strong>Now it is totally free</strong> so your income for the time you played AFK will be much more significant.</p>
<p>We would also like to let you know the you can find in the game an item called <strong>Box of Tickets</strong>. If you find it and use it, you will get a free invitation to one of the in-game events. What is more, if you find i.e. a DS (Devil Square) invitation, it will work on all DS levels (DS1 to DS). So the invitation works on all event levels.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have also added a new feature on our website that you can see below. Itâ€™s the Event Calendar and it allows you to check really quickly when is the next i.e. BC. I hope you like it.</p>
<p>Please also remember that you can contact us if you have any issues on our <a href="http://forum.everwintermu.com" target="_blank">message board</a>.</p>
